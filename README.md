# HospitalDatabase
This is simple sql code for the creation and management of a hospital themed database pertaining to employee information, 
and patient information; as well should be easily expandable.

ERDiagram.pdf contains a visual representation of the database as a whole.

databaseCreationAndSampleData.sql contains the creation of tables and the insertion of simple sample data 
as represented by the ER diagram of the database.

sampleQueries.sql contains queries that could be run frequently as employees/managers require, however 
I have no experience working in the medical field, so these queries may not be as necessary in a real system.

sampleFunctions.sql contains scripting for a veriety of functions, such as hiring a new employee, setting on call
hours for a specified employee, admitting a patient. If in a real system these scripts could easily be embedded within 
javascript, c++ , c#, or any other language.
